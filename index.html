        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
            <p>
                I am currently working as a Business QA Associate at HSBC Software Development (Guangdong) Co., Ltd., 
                with strong expertise in Java backend development, Spring Boot, and microservices architecture. I am actively seeking to transition 
                into a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> role where I can leverage my deep understanding of system architecture, API design, 
                and quality engineering to build robust and scalable solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                My QA experience has provided me with unique insights into the complete software development lifecycle - from requirements analysis 
                and system design to deployment and monitoring. Working across credit card systems, loan processing platforms, and rewards management 
                applications, I've gained hands-on experience with multi-system integration, data flow optimization, and end-to-end testing automation. 
                I bring a quality-first engineering mindset and am passionate about writing clean, maintainable code while continuously learning 
                emerging technologies including AI and modern development practices.
